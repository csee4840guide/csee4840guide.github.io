  <p>
  The <strong>Embedded Systems Survival Guide</strong> is a collection of
  helpful information and resources for students in Columbia's
  <em>CSEE 4840: Embedded Systems Design</em> class written by former students.
  The guide aims to provide useful supplemental information to the course
  material that will ease the development cycle for students working on the
  final class project. The guide includes helpful tips on writing VHDL and
  using the Altera design tools.
  </p>
  <p>
  The guide does not include detailed documentation on interfacing with the
  hardware peripherals of the DE2 development board. It is expected that
  students will figure this out for themselves through careful analysis of the
  datasheets and example code, along with a great deal of trial and error.
  Learning how to read hardware documentation and build drivers based on the
  documentation is one of the most important skills to be learned in the class.
  The authors of the guide believe it to be counter-productive to deprive
  students of this experiential learning.
  </p>
  <p>
  The guide also does not cover the theory of embedded systems, nor general
  guidelines for architecting a system and organizing a project. as it is
  expected that these things will be learned through the class lectures and
  lecture slides.
